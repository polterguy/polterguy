# Magic Cloud - Low-Code, No-Code, and AI-based Software Development

Magic Cloud is a software development automation framework created and maintained by [AINIRO.IO](https://ainiro.io) that creates backend APIs _"automagically"_. Magic was created to allow developers to automatically CRUD API backends, in addition to using workflows to create and orchestrate backend code in a _"drag'n'drop"_ interface. Magic almost contains everything needed for you to setup and administrate your own cloud-based backend software development platform.

## Endpoints Generator

The [Endpoints Generator](https://docs.ainiro.io/dashboard/endpoint-generator/) allows you to choose a database and click a button, resulting in having every table in your database securely wrapped into CRUD API endpoints 100% automatically. You can also create endpoints using only SQL with Magic.

## SQL Studio

With [SQL Studio](https://docs.ainiro.io/dashboard/sql-studio/) you can write and execute SQL from anywhere, using any device you might have available. SQL Studio also allows you to save and load frequently used SQL snippets, simplifying your job significantly.

## Hyper IDE

With [Hyper IDE](https://docs.ainiro.io/dashboard/hyper-ide/) you can edit your code from your browser. However, its primary feature of course is that it _automatically generates 80% of your code_ without much effort required from you.

## Additional features

Magic comes with a whole range of additional tools simplifying your software development creation and management life cycle.

## Hyperlambda

Magic is based upon a unique programming language DSL engine, similar to YAML in syntax, that creates your code almost automatically. Hyperlambda lends itself to workflows, software development automation orchestration, and code generation due to its dynamic nature.
