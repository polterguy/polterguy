# Aista Magic Cloud - A CRUD APP generator

**Aista Magic Cloud** is a software development platform that **creates CRUD apps automatically**. **[Magic Cloud](https://aista.com)** was created to allow developers to automate tasks associated with creating CRUD API backends and CRUD datagrid frontends. However, it's really a _"next generation software development platform"_, containing everything needed for you to setup and administrate your own low-code cloud system.

## Hyperlambda

Aista Magic Cloud is based upon a unique programming language DSL, similar to YAML in syntax, that literally creates your code almost 100% automatically, allowing you to focus on the interesting parts of your job, leaving the boring parts to Magic. When our founder [wrote an article about Hyperlambda for Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2017/june/csharp-make-csharp-more-dynamic-with-hyperlambda), it became the 5th most read article in MSDN Magazine's 35+ years of existence.

## Licensing

Magic Cloud is 100% open source, using fairly permissive licenses, such as MIT and LGPL, allowing you to consume it as you see fit, also in _"proprietary"_ (closed source) projects. Our licensing terms basically allows you to consume Magic as you see fit, as long as modifications to the code base itself _remains_ open source.
