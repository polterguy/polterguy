# Aista Magic Cloud - A CRUD API generator

**Aista Magic Cloud** is a platform that **creates CRUD apps automatically**. **[Magic Cloud](https://aista.com)** was created to allow developers to automate tasks associated with primarily CRUD API backends, but also generates Angular frontends wrapping your CRUD API.

## Our vision

**Automate 80% of software development** through intelligent consumption of meta data from SQL based relational database systems, and other systems exposing meta data allowing us to automatically scaffold and generate code.
