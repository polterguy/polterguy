# Aista Magic Cloud - A CRUD APP generator

**Aista Magic Cloud** is a software development platform that **creates CRUD apps automatically**. **[Magic Cloud](https://aista.com)** was created to allow developers to automate tasks associated with creating CRUD API backends and CRUD datagrid frontends. However, it's really a _"next generation software development platform"_, containing everything needed for you to setup and administrate your own low-code cloud system.

## Our vision

**Automate 80% of software development** through intelligent use of meta data from SQL based relational database systems, and other systems exposing meta data, allowing you to automatically generate and scaffold code.
